Proteins are essential to a wide range of biological processes. Proteins consist of amino acids, which are the building blocks of these macromolecules. The amino acids form a chain that determines the protein's structure and function. Specific amino acids, referred to as binding, are more likely to interact with other molecules called ligands. This interaction is a fundamental property to drug discovery and research \cite{trainor2007importance}, \cite{ballante2021protein}, \cite{mannhold2006protein}.

Detecting such residues, individual amino acids within the protein structure, is challenging. Various computational methods have been developed to predict potential binding residues, which are further grouped into distinct binding regions (also referred to as binding sites) based on the location of the residues \cite{krivak2018p2rank}, \cite{le2009fpocket}, \cite{aggarwal2021deeppocket}, \cite{smith2024graph}. Specific binding residues may experience structural changes due to the dynamic nature of these regions, becoming cryptic binding residues (CBRs) that pose greater identification challenges. While current methods may detect cryptic binding sites (CBSs), their models are generally trained to identify any binding residues, rather than being focused explicitly on CBSs.

A dataset and methodology for detecting CBRs, CryptoBench \cite{vskrhak2025cryptobench}, was previously developed at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University. This thesis has two primary objectives.

The first goal is to extend this approach by clustering individually predicted CBRs from the CryptoBench model into structurally contiguous regions called CBSs. This methodology may also apply to other prediction methods.

The second objective is to develop a user-friendly client-server web application, CryptoShow, enabling users to submit protein structures and obtain CBR predictions. These predictions would be clustered into distinct binding sites and visualized for the user, including animations that illustrate potential conformational changes between the protein's initial state and analogous structures identified using the AHoJ tool \cite{feidakis2022ahoj}.

This thesis is structured in four chapters, and it is organized as follows:

Chapter 1 provides an overview of bioinformatics, introducing key terminology, concepts, and relevant tools that underpin subsequent work.

Chapter 2 details the methodological framework, beginning with predicting cryptic binding residues using the CryptoBench model. The prediction is followed by describing the clustering approach for grouping CBRs into cryptic binding sites, enhanced by a newly introduced smoothing model. It concludes with an evaluation of the overall performance.

Chapter 3 presents the design and implementation of the CryptoShow web application. This presentation includes a discussion of the technology stack, architectural and design choices, and an in-depth look at both the backend and the frontend, particularly the integration of Mol* for 3D structure visualization \cite{sehnal2021mol}. Deployment and maintenance considerations are also addressed.

Finally, Chapter 4 serves as user documentation, outlining the application's main functionalities and illustrating a typical use case.
